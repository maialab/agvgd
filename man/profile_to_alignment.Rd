\title{Converts a sequence profile to an alignment}
\usage{
profile_to_alignment(profile)
}
\arguments{
\item{profile}{A sequence profile object as returned by
\code{\link[protean:read_profile]{protean::read_profile()}} or \code{\link[protean:get_profile]{protean::get_profile()}}.}
}
\value{
An alignment object, i.e. a character matrix whose elements are
protein residues in one-letter notation. Rows are sequences and columns are

\description{
This function converts a sequence profile as provided in the format of the
package \code{{protean}} to an \code{{agvgd}} alignment --- an alignment in this sense
is simply a character matrix whose elements are protein residues in
one-letter notation, rows are sequences and columns correspond to alignment
positions.
